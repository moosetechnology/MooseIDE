"
A ""fake"" UITheme with the sole purpose of overriding #overTextCursorFor:

The new implementation changes the cursor in the rendered to a hand instead of a ""text cursor""
(see also MiSourceTextBrowser >> open)

Note: this could be a subclass of UITheme, but creating a theme is an heavy operation that we do not want to wait for.
So instead it is a simple object that forwards every message not understood to the real UITheme (a singleton).

There could be a problem if UITheme overrides a method of Object which will therefore not be NotUnderstood and will execute the default Object implementation instead of the UITheme implementation
This happens for #postCopy and we should think whether it needs to be treated in a special way.
